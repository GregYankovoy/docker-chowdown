A lot of places are doing dang good brussels lately, but none can touch [Salty Sow](http://saltysow.com/). They serve them fried, topped with pecorino and golden raisins. Yes, please.

We started trying to emulate it, but it's such a versatile dish, you can make it however you want. Consider this a loose guide.
